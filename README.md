# Getting started
- Download and install Node 14 LTS
- navigate inside my project root folder run the following command:
  `npm i`

# Running the project
## Demo 
`npm start`
This will run index.ts which is configured using the index.ts module level variable "targetSku"
  
## Unit tests
`npm test`
This will run the unit tests for the project

## Linting
`npm run lint`
This runs eslint against my project
 

# Technical Test 
## User story:
- As an interviewer I want a function which is able to:
  - return the current stock levels for a given SKU
    (by combining the data in these two files).

## Requirements:
- [x] must match the following signature: `(sku: string) => Promise<{ sku: string, qty: number }>`.
- [x] must read from the `stock` and `transactions` files on each invocation (totals cannot be precomputed)
- [x] must throw an error where the SKU does not exist in the `transactions.json` and `stock.json` file
- [x] Transactions may exist for SKUs which are not present in `stock.json`. It should be assumed that the starting quantity for these is 0.
- [x] Functionality can be split into many files to help keep the project clear and organised 
- [x] all code adequately unit tested

Ambiguity (questions for product owner / business analyst):
- [x] refunds 
  - in the transactions.json there are refunds and orders
  - should refunds be added back into the stock?
  - for the sake of this technical test I have assumed the product owner has
    given sign off for refunds to be added back into the stock
    but with the added benefit of a feature flag

## Issues with technical test:
Itâ€™s worth noting that through more thorough unit testing I discovered an issue with the technical test:

It's due to stock levels not being high enough for demand. 
In this situation I'd speak to Product owner. 
We could implement a safety check for this but it is currently not part of the acceptance criteria

The issue can be seen with this SKU id:
```
==== Checking NJL093603/01/73 ====
transactions['NJL093603/01/73'] = [(1, 'order'), (4, 'order'), (4, 'order'), (10, 'refund'), (6, 'order'), (9, 'refund'), (7, 'order'), (8, 'order'), (0, 'refund'), (8, 'order'), (9, 'refund'), (9, 'order'), (9, 'order'), (3, 'refund'), (4, 'order'), (7, 'order'), (10, 'order'), (10, 'order')]
Initial stock value / stock['NJL093603/01/73'] = 0
Totals for orders: 87
Totals for refunds: 31
Grand total (with refunds): 0 - 87 + 31 = -56
Grand total (without refunds): 0 - 87 = -87
```

I did, however, implement a little check and you can see it in the program output:

```
> robert-rendell-technical-test-190821@1.0.0 start C:\Users\rob_4\Desktop\Robert-Rendell-PLT-Technical-Test-190821
> ts-node index.ts

The program will add refunds back into the sellable stock
SKU NJL093603/01/73 stock level dropped below 0
SKU NJL093603/01/73 stock level dropped below 0
SKU NJL093603/01/73 stock level dropped below 0
Stock level for SKU (NJL093603/01/73) is: -56
```

# Improvements to my code
There are currently 4 possible improvements (IMOO):
- use envalid/dotenv to populate ApplicationConfig in config.service.ts
- use async / await version of read file from 'fs' node built in package in resource.service.ts
- mock out ResourceService fully in stock.service.ts
- fix deprecated use of doneFn in stock.service.spec.ts

I'm open to more suggestions, code reviews are always a school day!
